    "answer": "It appears that there are no results available for the analysis of loan amounts and internal portfolio risk ratings broken down by risk category. This could be due to a lack of data in the database for the specified criteria or the absence of relevant records. \n\nTo conduct a comprehensive analysis, we would typically look for the following information:\n- Total loan amounts categorized by different risk ratings (e.g., low, medium, high).\n- The number of loans in each risk category.\n- Average loan amounts per risk category.\n\nSince no data was returned, it may be beneficial to verify the data availability or the parameters used for the query.",
