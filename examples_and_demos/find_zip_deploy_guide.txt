🔍 FINDING THE ZIP DEPLOY OPTION:

📋 METHOD 1: Via Deployment Center (Sometimes Hidden)
====================================================
1. Go to your Function App "fisfunctionpoc" in Azure Portal
2. In the left menu, click "Deployment Center"
3. Look for tabs at the top of the main area:
   • You might see: "GitHub", "Azure DevOps", "Local Git", etc.
   • Look for a tab called "ZIP Deploy" or "External"
   • If you don't see "ZIP Deploy", try Method 2 below

📋 METHOD 2: Via Advanced Tools (Kudu) - ALWAYS WORKS
=====================================================
1. In your Function App, scroll down in the left menu
2. Find "Advanced Tools" (under Development Tools section)
3. Click "Advanced Tools" → Click "Go" button
4. This opens the Kudu console in a new tab
5. In Kudu, click "Tools" menu → "Zip Push Deploy"
6. Drag and drop your "image_processing_functions.zip" file
7. Wait for deployment to complete

📋 METHOD 3: Via Azure CLI (Alternative)
========================================
Since we had authentication issues, let's try with run-from-package:
az functionapp config appsettings set \
    --resource-group "FIS-Internal" \
    --name "fisfunctionpoc" \
    --settings WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE="1"

Then try deployment again.

📋 METHOD 4: Via Development Tools Menu
=======================================
1. In your Function App left menu, look for "Development Tools"
2. Click "App Service Editor" or "Console"
3. Some Function Apps have deployment options here

📋 VISUAL GUIDE FOR KUDU METHOD:
================================
Function App → Advanced Tools → Go → Tools Menu → Zip Push Deploy

This method ALWAYS works and bypasses authentication issues!
