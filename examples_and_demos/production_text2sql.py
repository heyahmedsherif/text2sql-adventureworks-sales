1. Use ONLY the exact column names shown in the schema above
2. Use SQLite syntax (no T-SQL functions)
3. Always include appropriate JOINs when querying multiple tables
4. Use LIMIT for large result sets
5. Handle NULL values appropriately
6. Return ONLY the SQL query, no explanations or formatting
7. Use these exact table and column names:

   - Customer names: CUSTOMER_NAME column
   - Customer types: CUSTOMER_TYPE_DESCRIPTION column  
   - Loan data: CL_DETAIL_FACT table
