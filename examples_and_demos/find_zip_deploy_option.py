🔍 FINDING THE ZIP DEPLOY OPTION:

📋 METHOD 1: Via Deployment Center (Sometimes Hidden)
====================================================
1. Go to your Function App "fisfunctionpoc" in Azure Portal
2. In the left menu, click "Deployment Center"
3. Look for tabs at the top of the main area:
   • You might see: "GitHub", "Azure DevOps", "Local Git", etc.
   • Look for a tab called "ZIP Deploy" or "External"
   • If you don't see "ZIP Deploy", try Method 2 below

📋 METHOD 2: Via Advanced Tools (Kudu) - ALWAYS WORKS
=====================================================
1. In your Function App, scroll down in the left menu
2. Find "Advanced Tools" (under Development Tools section)
3. Click "Advanced Tools" → Click "Go" button
4. This opens the Kudu console in a new tab
5. In Kudu, click "Tools" menu → "Zip Push Deploy"
6. Drag and drop your "image_processing_functions.zip" file
7. Wait for deployment to complete

📋 METHOD 3: Via Azure CLI (Alternative)
========================================
Since we had authentication issues, let's try with run-from-package:
az functionapp config appsettings set \\
    --resource-group "FIS-Internal" \\
    --name "fisfunctionpoc" \\
    --settings WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE="1"

Then try deployment again.

📋 METHOD 4: Via Development Tools Menu
=======================================
1. In your Function App left menu, look for "Development Tools"
2. Click "App Service Editor" or "Console"
3. Some Function Apps have deployment options here

📋 VISUAL GUIDE FOR KUDU METHOD:
================================
Function App → Advanced Tools → Go → Tools Menu → Zip Push Deploy

This method ALWAYS works and bypasses authentication issues!

💡 ALTERNATIVE 1: VS CODE DEPLOYMENT
=====================================
If you have VS Code with Azure Functions extension:
1. Install "Azure Functions" extension in VS Code
2. Sign in to your Azure account
3. Find your Function App in the Azure panel
4. Right-click → "Deploy to Function App"
5. Select the zip file or the folder

💡 ALTERNATIVE 2: DIRECT KUDU API
==================================
You can also deploy directly via REST API:
1. Get your Function App publish profile from Azure Portal
2. Use curl or PowerShell to upload the zip

💡 ALTERNATIVE 3: MANUAL FILE UPLOAD
====================================
If all else fails, you can manually upload files:
1. Go to Advanced Tools (Kudu)
2. Click "Debug console" → "CMD"
3. Navigate to site/wwwroot
4. Upload individual Python files manually
5. Upload requirements.txt
6. Let Azure handle the dependencies

🎯 RECOMMENDED: Use the Kudu method (Advanced Tools)
This method bypasses all authentication issues and works reliably.

📋 STEP-BY-STEP KUDU DEPLOYMENT:

1. 🔍 NAVIGATE TO FUNCTION APP
   • Open Azure Portal
   • Search for "fisfunctionpoc"
   • Click on your Function App

2. 🔧 OPEN ADVANCED TOOLS
   • Scroll down in the left menu
   • Under "Development Tools" section, find "Advanced Tools"
   • Click "Advanced Tools"
   • Click the "Go" button (opens new tab)

3. 🎯 ACCESS ZIP DEPLOYMENT
   • In the Kudu console (new tab), you'll see a menu bar
   • Click "Tools" in the top menu
   • Select "Zip Push Deploy" from dropdown

4. 📦 UPLOAD ZIP FILE
   • You'll see a drag-and-drop area
   • Drag "image_processing_functions.zip" into the area
   • OR click "Browse" to select the file
   • The upload and deployment will start automatically

5. ⏳ WAIT FOR COMPLETION
   • You'll see a progress indicator
   • Wait for "Deployment successful" message
   • This usually takes 2-3 minutes

6. ✅ VERIFY DEPLOYMENT
   • Go back to your Function App tab
   • Refresh the page
   • Click "Functions" in the left menu
   • You should see 5 new functions

🎯 WHY KUDU WORKS:
• Kudu is the deployment engine behind Azure App Service
• It bypasses the authentication issues we encountered
• It's the most direct way to deploy code
• Used by all other deployment methods internally

💡 KUDU CONSOLE FEATURES:
• File browser for your app
• Debug console for troubleshooting  
• Direct ZIP deployment
• Process monitoring
• Log file access
