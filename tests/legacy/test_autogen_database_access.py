Based on the FIS Banking database analysis, customers are classified into different risk ratings using THREE distinct evaluation sources:

1. **OFFICER RISK RATINGS** (OFFICER_RISK_RATING_DESC):
   - Primary ratings: A STABLE, A+ STABLE, EXCELLENT CREDIT, STRONG CREDIT, GOOD CREDIT
   - Most common rating: A STABLE (809 customers)
   - Used by loan officers for day-to-day risk assessment

2. **CREDIT REVIEW RATINGS** (CREDIT_REVIEW_RISK_RATING_DESC):  
   - Independent credit review assessment
   - Provides secondary validation of officer ratings
   - Used for portfolio oversight and validation

3. **REGULATOR RATINGS** (REGULATOR_RISK_RATING_DESC):
   - Regulatory compliance ratings
   - Aligned with banking regulatory requirements
   - Used for regulatory reporting and compliance

**Multi-Dimensional Assessment**: The database shows that customers receive ratings from all three sources, providing a comprehensive risk profile. For example, major borrowers like BORROWER 1 have ratings across all three dimensions to ensure thorough risk evaluation.

**Rating Distribution**: The portfolio shows concentration in higher-quality credits, with EXCELLENT CREDIT and A STABLE representing the largest customer segments, indicating a conservative risk profile.
